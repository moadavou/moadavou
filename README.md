## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Moa, a future front-end developer from Sweden

I'm a front-end developer and web designer in production with a passion for functional, accessible, and well-tested UIs and Uxs. 

Outside of programming, my biggest issue in life is having too many hobbies. I find a new one every few months. Fitness, indoor gardening, and playing the violin are just a few.
